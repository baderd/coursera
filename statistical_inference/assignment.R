#' # Simulation excercise
#' In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and 
#' compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R 
#' with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean 
#' of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. 
#' Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. 
LAMBDA=0.2
#' You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. 
#' Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations.
